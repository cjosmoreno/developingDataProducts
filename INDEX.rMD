Description
The Shiny App I wrote displays energy consumption information:
•gas
•electricity
•water

for the years 2012 to 2014.



Details
Every Sunday, I write down in an Excel sheet the figures displayed by the different meters.

These data are diffed, week by week, so that I get the week's consumption.

Further more, a formula is applied to compute an estimate price (expressed in EUR) for the week's consumption.



Example
Here are the first 10 lines of the Excel file (for the columns which interest me, the ones I show in the barplot):

data <- read.csv("~/src/refcard-R/course-project/consumption.csv", sep=",", header=T)
subset(data, select=c(Date,PriceGas,PriceElec,PriceWater))[1:10, ]



Lessons learned
•Necessary to use reactive function as soon as I have 2 inputs or more.


•In the renderPlot function, the name of the dataframe must be followed by parentheses.




Conclusion
•Writing the application + these slides took me around 3 hours. That's pretty excellent for making such a huge work available (displayable, testable) by third parties. A wonder, in fact.


•With these R technologies, I really feel I stand on the shoulders of giants.
